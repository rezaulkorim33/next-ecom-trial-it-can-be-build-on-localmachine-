Sir Niraj,

I kindly ask you to review the explanation video I shared. In the video, I demonstrate the complete process of how I built and deployed my project successfully on my local machine and on Vercel. However, the deployment failed when attempting to access the page on Vercel.

Please note that there are three things not shown in the video:

I updated an outdated npm dependency called "caniuse-lite."
In app/components/ProductForm.tsx, the useEffect hook was missing a dependency, "initialValue," which I added later.
In app/verify/page.tsx, the useEffect hook was missing three dependencies: "router," "token," and "userId," which I added afterward.
These issues were flagged as warnings during the local build process. After updating the code, I restarted the build process from the beginning.
